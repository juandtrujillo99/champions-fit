# champions-fit
The project where I combine my two loves, workout and design.

This was developed for my second home, Champions Fit was the place where I started my workout sessions and this changed my life completely.

In this project I aplied new developping methods for first time with PHP, integrating scripts, repositories, dinamic headers and many more.

The users can be registered, login and have profiles with their information like name, birth, profile picture a read exclusive content from champions fit blog.

finally, I want to say that the UX/UI it is not the best but this it was my first big project.
